# Lab 6

Collaborators:

    For this lab I attended section three times this week, two being Navids's section and the the last on with Gao. During those time I would ask the instructors, and the T.A.s for help on understand the lab. Outside of Section I would collaborate with other students, Christian and Darren, and would help explain more so on the project itself, and any confusing concepts.

Summary:

Lab6 was an intro to understanding how to write code to manipulate the micro-controller given to us. It include understanding how to manipulate the micro-controllers OLEDS, Switches, Analogue Dial, and Buttons. The highlight were understanding how bit notation heavily plays with the micro-controller, and event-driven programming.

Approach:

    I started by first working on the Lab06_LED and Bounce Timer on Tuesday Morning took more time since it I was consulting with classmate if my implementation was correct, after that it was me working on the switch for most of the day till Wednesday Morning, understanding that my output was off because I didn't implement an unsigned char. By Wednesday I had finished my implementation with the adc. By Thursday to today I have started working on buttons.c, buttons_test.c, and bounce_buttons.c

Overall Feeling:

    - Interesting Lab, but I think more time was need for this one because implementing the buttons is more difficult task then it should be
    - I liked it more when I was completing it, but I definitely found this lab quite more difficult
