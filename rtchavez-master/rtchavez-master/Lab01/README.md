In Lab 1 I did the Following:

    1. Created a simple Hello World File
    2. Learned how to Debug onto the MPLABs and navigate/use MPLABS
    3. Created File tha prints table conversions of temperatures
    4. Learned how to run code onto the Uno32

Mistakes I made:

    - Early on I couldn't compile the code because it specified it need a heaps so I modified them in the project properties so that the code could run

    - My Uno32 wasn't working so I asked a tutor for advice so I can fix the problems with how to either replace or repair it

    - There was a compiler error, when I was trying to print the scale, but all I had to do was change %d interger to %f float

    - My code for the extra credit on the Uno32 wasn't showing until, a tested a second time, and the TA corrected a small error in my code

Feedback:
	Overall it was very simple project,and I didn't have much trouble with the project, but just setting up all the software in my computer.
