Summary:

Similar to Lab3, where we have to implement a file that computes various mathematical function, it differs from Lab2 by focusing more so: concepts from Liner Algebra Concepts, understanding how to use the arrays and matrices in C, and in practicality it focused Writing a Library and Unit Testing in programming in general. Composed of the Matrix Math Library and the Test File for the Library, they determined if the functions I have implemented work properly.

Approach:

My Approach was straight forward I would focus on first making a template for the Math Library, and then slowly test each function afterwards. When testing, I would use the same three matrices and calculate the result on matrix calculator online, I would then record the results a in the code to see if the code was working perfectly. In the case it the results don't match I print out a table of both the expected and give results to then see where in my code was buggy. Often it was a typo, a something I didn't consider to be necessary in the code. After Debugging my code I would then work or reformating my test file so it would fit more with the description on the document, abd after that polish the project just to make it more neater.

Feedback:

More of question than a consideration, but when the document mention on the example output it seemed to skip MatrixSubmatrix.
Time Wise, I started on Monday Morning and finished Friday Morning(1:52 am as I am writing this), honestly I think it the testing that takes more time, and It would have taken me 2-3 days to finish this project, but the testing can be pretty tedious. It's not the most difficult, but it was pretty manageable. My only suggestion would have just be to implement pointer, since yes it uses arrays, but I just think pointer could have interesting to implement in this project, just more so to better grasp the concept.
