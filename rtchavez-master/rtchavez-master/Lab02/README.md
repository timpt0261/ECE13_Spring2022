When the line: `scanf(" ");` executes the terminal waits for any for of user input and then continues to the rest of the code.

The reason why is scanf() and printf need to be only in CalculatorRun, was because in this case it would have effected efficiently our code would run. If in the case any of our math functions had a scanf(), then the parameters of the function would be undermined, and with printf the return statement would be undermined as well.

Overall I was partly done by Tuesday, and spent ~2 hours just debugging and making sure everything was working in the correct conation. The project was easy to implement from the start, and not that time consuming as I was more familiar on how to implement the code from previous projects.
